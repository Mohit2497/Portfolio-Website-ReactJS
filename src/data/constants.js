Leveraging complex SQL queries and JOIN operations, I established robust relationships among six data tables, enhancing data connectivity across multiple spreadsheets and enabling the periodic update of data every 24 hours. Through the strategic implementation of Python scripts, I achieved a notable 65% enhancement in client onboarding processes, optimizing workflows, minimizing data duplication, and establishing clear project guidelines. Working alongside data owners and stakeholders from various product areas, I spearheaded efforts to validate and verify data accuracy, implementing rigorous processes that led to a 70% reduction in inconsistencies, duplications, and inaccuracies. Additionally, I integrated data from four databases using SQL to develop a real-time dashboard in Google Data Studio, offering comprehensive insights into 30 client locations and capturing key metrics. Through proactive maintenance and updates, I successfully decreased SQL script-related issues by 12% and boosted script performance by 20%, resulting in enhanced productivity and streamlined workflows across the board.",
